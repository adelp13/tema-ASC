This is an assembly program which calculates the adjacency matrix based on the adjancy lists of an oriented graph.
The second task is to find the number of paths of a given length (k) between nodes a and b. The result is obtained my multiplying the adjacency matrix with itself for k times.
<br> For doing so, the code implements a method matix_mult which calculates the product of 2 matrices.
**The requieremets for the code presented are:**
